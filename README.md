# Foodie Go

## About
Foodie Go is a Pokémon Go like app centered around connecting foodies, introducing them to new places to eat, and overall making finding new places fun! Upon starting Foodie Go each new user will be able to create an account and add friends whenever desired. 

Once logged in, the user will launch into a main view which will consist of a simplified map showing all nearby locations to eat. The user is then able to look around the map and click on any of the locations. Upon clicking a location, a more detailed view will come up showing them that location’s rating, reviews from their friends, activity happening at the location, and more. 

Upon travelling to a new location, the user will have the option to receive a token unique to that location symbolizing their trip there. This token can also be visible to friends so the user can show it off & gain bragging rights. Finally, after eating, the user can leave a review so other foodies, namely their friends, have a better idea of what the location is like.

Finally, while in the main map view, the user has the option to request a recommendation. Upon requesting this, the app will take some time to crunch the numbers and come up with a recommended location to eat based off the user’s friends’ reviews, activities, and overall ratings of different locations. Once a recommendation is found, the detailed view for that location will pop up so the user can learn more about it. As more people invite their friends to use Foodie-Go, the ecosystem will grow, and recommendations will become more reliable. 

Foodie-Go not only aims to eliminate the dread that busy foodies face when they are not able to search for new places to eat, but also aims to connect foodies together and help them have fun along the way!
